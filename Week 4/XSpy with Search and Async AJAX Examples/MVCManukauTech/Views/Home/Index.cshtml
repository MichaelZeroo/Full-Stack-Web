    &quot;XSpy&quot; is a sample web app on the ASP.NET MVC5.2 framework with a demo shopping cart and demo of some student-friendly ideas on getting started with MVC.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;XSpy&quot; uses sample data from &quot;IBuySpy&quot;, the &quot;Microsoft E-Commerce Starter Kit&quot; (2003).<br />
    Most sample data is therefore  © Copyright 2003 Microsoft Corporation.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;XSpy&quot; coding has been done by us as an all new sample web app.<br />

    Our approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Sticking close to the essentials of what makes MVC5.<br/>
        This keeps &quot;XSpy&quot; close to common standards like SQL and HTML5 - which means low use
        of custom elements like "HtmlHelpers".<br/>
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Shopping Cart with row by row database updates via AJAX<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Database table &quot;OrderDetails&quot; gains column "LineNumbers".&nbsp;<br />
        Added to reflect our experience of programming for Shipping and Warehousing systems<br />
        where Item Line Numbers are a common point of reference for workers.<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
